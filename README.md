# Transforming the Engineering Space: The Impact of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Deep Learning (DL) on Team Dynamics, Work Ethics, Conflict Resolution, and Business Decisions

The project explored the transformative impact of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Deep Learning (DL) on engineering, examining how AI-driven automation reshaped team dynamics, work ethics, conflict resolution, and business decision-making. With AI expected to influence up to 45% of work activities by 2030, the study analyzed its effects on communication, ethical considerations, skill evolution, and strategic planning. Research involved surveys of engineering professionals, interviews with industry experts, and analysis of academic literature to assess AIâ€™s role in professional growth. Insights from interviews, including those with **Venu Ganapuram, Senior Principal Scientist at CSIR - NAL, Government of India (19.5 years of experience), and Ayan Pal, a GIC Learning Consultant at IBM Consulting (18 years of experience),** provided a deeper understanding of AI adoption's impact on engineering teams and managerial decision-making. The findings aimed to guide engineering managers in navigating AI-driven transformations while fostering responsible AI adoption, improved collaboration, and strategic innovation.
